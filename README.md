# Introduction

This a work-in-progress project bringing Prey 2006 game into VR (on Oculus Quest 2).

Running this game require a copy of the original Prey 2006 data. Tested on English version patched with 1.4 patch.

Copy the `base` folder from the original game into the headset as `PreyVR/preybase`.

# Project family tree

PreyVR is based on a combination of the excellent projects created by opensource community.
I tried to create a kind of fmaily tree to keep track of the project's roots.
