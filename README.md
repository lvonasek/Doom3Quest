# Introduction

This a work-in-progress project bringing Prey 2006 game into VR (on Oculus Quest 2).

# Instructions

Running this game require a copy of the original Prey 2006 data. Tested on English version patched with 1.4 patch.

* Install the APK from github via Sidequest and open it once on your headset. It will close down. It has created the folders `preyvr/preybase`.
* Go to your steam installation of Prey. Navigate to `prey/base` on your PC. Copy all PK4 files from there to `preyvr/preybase` on your headset.
* Prey (2006) is delisted on Steam. But you can buy and redeem a steam key from a key reseller of your choice just fine.

# Project family tree

PreyVR is based on a combination of the excellent projects created by opensource community.
I tried to create a kind of fmaily tree to keep track of the project's roots.
